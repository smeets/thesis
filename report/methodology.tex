\chapter{Methodology}

This section describes the methodology we used to analyse the models.

\section{Data Collection}

How did we get the data? What did we get?

\section{Model Selection}

Which models did we elect to use and how did we simplify/change them?

\section{Parameter Extraction}

In order to evaluate the models we needed these parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\item rssi
\item nodes
\item logical tx/rx rates
\item physical tx/rx rates
\end{itemize}

\section{Parameter Analysis}

We must analyse the validity of the reported parameters.

Do this with experimentation in the radio lab.
