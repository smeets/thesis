The demand and need for wireless networking is high. 

Consumers have high expectations.

Network devices are deployed and configured in a decentralised fashion. 

Original IEEE 802.11 solution was not made for today's problem.

Results in many types of problems wrt. customer experience. 

When customer expectations are not met they call their Internet Service Provider (ISP) support line and complain.

ISP often not involved in problem but still needs to please customer - sends technician.

Customer is pleased but at a significant cost to the ISP.

Technician's solution can result in problems for neighbours -- ping/pong or ripple effect.

Core problem: usage and deployment scenario different than standard imagined.

Not possible to replace IEEE 802.11 for the foreseeable future.

Possible solutions: 

 - centralised configuration (still in future)
 - reconfiguration recommendation based on network-wide overview (requires competent models and data collection)
 - ??

Recommend configuration based on both detailed and wide view of network performance.

To recommend a change it must lead to improvement in some aspect.

How to be sure of this? Model the network and simulate what happens when the change is made.

This requires competent Wi-Fi models.

Must have clear definition of a competent Wi-Fi model is.

Wi-Fi models with good performance in simulated tests need not be as good in the real world.

So we have to test this, and we need the data to do it.

Telenor now has a good platform for us to get the data.

But can we trust it? Perhaps the logging is inaccurate?

So we need to analyse the quality of the data.

 - is it accurate?
 - is it precise?

Experiments will be conducted and results will impact model testing and evaluation.
