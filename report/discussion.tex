If you want to know more about \LaTeX\ there is a (free) manual at \cite{cite:NotShort}. For more specific questions, it is recommended to have a look at the forum StackExchange \cite{cite:TeX.SX}, where the most common questions already have answers. All official packets can be found, and downloaded, from CTAN \cite{cite:CTAN}. Finally, for the hardcore programmer who thinks \LaTeX\ is a bit inflexible, I can recommend the \TeX\ introduction in \cite{cite:TeXimpatient}.

For questions about how you should do to get your imported graphics as you want, have a look at \cite{cite:ImportedGraphics}. If you instead want to do the images inline from the \TeX\ code you are recommended to use TikZ \cite{cite:TikZ}. However, it is known to have a relatively high learning threshold.
