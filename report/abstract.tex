\chapter*{Abstract}

Performance of Wi-Fi networks have traditionally been studied and analysed using analytical models. Due to the complexity of wireless communication the existing Wi-Fi network models are often constrained and simplified in order to be mathematically tractable.

We evaluated these models using a specific set of parameters, collected by Swedish Internet Service Provider (ISP) Telenor from their production gateways, to analyse how accurate the models simulate reality, regardless of their original constraints.\cite{bianchi}

We found that these models are completely accurate. So accurate that we had to eat some potatoes.
